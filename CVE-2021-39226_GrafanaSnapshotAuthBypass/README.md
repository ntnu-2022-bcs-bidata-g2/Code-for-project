# CVE-2021-39226 - Grafana Snapshot Authentication Bypass

## Setting up environment
1.  Run ```docker-compose -f docker-compose_X.Y.Z.yml  up```, where X.Y.Z is the version, to start the container.
1.  Run ```./create_snapshot.sh``` to create a snapshop (can be done outside container, because it will connect to it through the open port).

## Scanning environment
Run ```nuclei -t nuclei.yml -u http://localhost:3000``` to test if instance is vulnerable.
